# 🐢 Turtle Race Betting Game

This is a fun and simple Python Turtle Graphics project where six turtles race across the screen, and the user places a bet on which colored turtle will win!

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Six turtles of different colors (`red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`) line up on the left side of the screen.
2. The user is prompted to place a bet by typing the color of the turtle they think will win.
3. The turtles move forward at random speeds in each iteration.
4. The first turtle to reach the finish line on the right wins.
5. A message is displayed to indicate whether the user won or lost the bet.
